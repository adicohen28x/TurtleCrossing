# TurtleCrossing
# About
This project is a Mini-Game in Python, following OOP and using the Turtle module. The goal of this game is to help a turtle to cross the street.

# Game instructions
Use the arrow up key to move the turtle to the other side of the street without getting hit by a car. Be careful as the cars will be moving faster, each time you level up.
